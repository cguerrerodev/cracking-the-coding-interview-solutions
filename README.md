# Cracking The Coding Interview Solutions

These are the solutions to the questions in the book "Cracking The Coding Interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowelltha that I've been developing to keep practicing algorithm problem solving

## Solved Questions

### Chapter 1

1.1 Is Unique: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you
cannot use additional data structures?

**Answer:** package

1.2 Check Permutation: Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the
other



1.3 URLify: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string
has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true"
length of the string. (Note: If implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can
perform this operation in place.)

EXAMPLE
", 13
Input: "Mr John Smith
Output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"



1.4 Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palinÂ­
drome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation
is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.

EXAMPLE
Input: Tact Coa
Output: True (permutations: "taco cat", "atco eta", etc.)
